    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tikka basically means anything that is marinated and then baked or grilled or fried and paneer tikka is a popular vegetarian tikka dish. This tasty homemade version is similar to the dish served in restaurants, but I would say actually tastes better! </p>
    <p>The Indian spice powders mixed with the yogurt (curd) make a flavorful marinade that is soaked up by the porous paneer cubes. Grilling the skewers then produces a nice slightly crispiness on the paneer.</p>

    <!--Recipe ingredients required-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Chilli pepper</li>
        <li>Ball pepper</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Paneer </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Peel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. Rinse and slice 1 small to medium sized capsicum (green bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. You will need ½ cup each of onions and capsicum. Keep aside. You can also use tomatoes if you want.</li>
        <li> Crush 1.5 inches ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium sized garlic to a fine paste in a mortar-pestle. You will need 1 tablespoon of crushed ginger-garlic or 1 tablespoon of ready ginger-garlic paste.</li>
        <li> Slice 200 to 250 grams block or paneer into cubes or squares and keep aside. Best is to use homemade paneer.</li>
        <li>Put 200 grams hung curd (greek yogurt) in a bowl. With a whisk beat the curd lightly till smooth. </li>
        <li>Now add 1 tablespoons ginger garlic paste or 1 tablespoon crushed ginger garlic to the curd. Also add all the dry spice powders. Below you see the following Indian spice powders in clockwise order:

            <ul>
                <li> 2 teaspoons kashmiri red chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chaat masala</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon black pepper powder (optional)</li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
            </ul>
            Kashmiri red chili powder gives a nice red color to the food but is not spicy and hot. Instead of kashmiri red chilli powder, you can add 2 teaspoons of sweet paprika or ½ to 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper..</li>
        <li>Finish with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon. </li>
    </ol>
